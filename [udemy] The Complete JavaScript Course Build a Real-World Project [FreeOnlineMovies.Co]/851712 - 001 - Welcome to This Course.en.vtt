00:00:00.436 --> 00:00:04.191
<v ->Hello, and welcome to The Complete JavaScript Course.</v>

2
00:00:04.191 --> 00:00:05.678
Thank you for signing up

3
00:00:05.678 --> 00:00:08.431
and for becoming a part of this course.

4
00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:12.443
This is your course, I designed and built it just for you.

5
00:00:12.443 --> 00:00:15.388
So, after months of planning, researching,

6
00:00:15.388 --> 00:00:18.766
filming, and perfecting every aspect of the course,

7
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:21.980
this is the best product that I've ever created.

8
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.870
And I really hope that it shows

9
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.184
and that you're gonna enjoy every minute of it.

10
00:00:27.184 --> 00:00:31.209
So, why JavaScript and not something else?

11
00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:33.178
And that's actually an easy answer,

12
00:00:33.178 --> 00:00:36.057
because today JavaScript is really the language

13
00:00:36.057 --> 00:00:38.739
that powers the entire internet.

14
00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.660
It allows developers to add complex dynamics

15
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.765
to websites and web apps,

16
00:00:43.765 --> 00:00:45.326
and it also allows us to use

17
00:00:45.326 --> 00:00:46.963
all of these popular frameworks,

18
00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:49.778
like React, Angular, and Node.js,

19
00:00:49.778 --> 00:00:53.127
to build even more advanced web applications.

20
00:00:53.127 --> 00:00:55.490
Now, all of this requires a deep

21
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.048
and true knowledge of the JavaScript language.

22
00:00:59.048 --> 00:01:00.976
But the problem is that many times

23
00:01:00.976 --> 00:01:04.599
JavaScript can be really confusing and hard to learn.

24
00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.878
And that's why I decided that I had to build this course,

25
00:01:07.878 --> 00:01:10.278
which is the course that I wish that I had

26
00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:12.248
when I first learned JavaScript,

27
00:01:12.248 --> 00:01:14.860
to help you take your web development career

28
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.045
to the next level.

29
00:01:17.045 --> 00:01:19.584
So this really is a complete course.

30
00:01:19.584 --> 00:01:21.495
We go all the way from the basics

31
00:01:21.495 --> 00:01:24.598
to the theory and really advanced stuff,

32
00:01:24.598 --> 00:01:28.284
and we're also gonna build two real-world beautiful apps

33
00:01:28.284 --> 00:01:30.528
that you're gonna be really proud of.

34
00:01:30.528 --> 00:01:33.809
So let's now see what we're gonna talk about in this course.

35
00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:35.463
So, we're gonna kick off the course

36
00:01:35.463 --> 00:01:38.119
with the very basics of the JavaScript language

37
00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.067
and of programming in general.

38
00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:41.997
So that you gain a very good foundation

39
00:01:41.997 --> 00:01:43.848
for the rest of the course.

40
00:01:43.848 --> 00:01:46.379
After that, we're gonna take a look

41
00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:48.787
behind the scenes of the JavaScript language,

42
00:01:48.787 --> 00:01:52.198
so that you learn how JavaScript actually works.

43
00:01:52.198 --> 00:01:55.069
And this is gonna be a good blend of theory

44
00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:58.525
and practical lectures that I designed specifically

45
00:01:58.525 --> 00:02:00.475
so that you can gain the knowledge

46
00:02:00.475 --> 00:02:04.351
that many JavaScript beginners out there simply don't have.

47
00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:07.633
So this is gonna be a very important section.

48
00:02:07.633 --> 00:02:10.117
We then move on to our very first project,

49
00:02:10.117 --> 00:02:12.374
where we're gonna use JavaScript in the browser

50
00:02:12.374 --> 00:02:14.799
for the very first time.

51
00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.431
So we're gonna code up this very cool game

52
00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:19.906
where we make JavaScript actually interact

53
00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:21.863
with an HTML webpage.

54
00:02:21.863 --> 00:02:23.926
Really cool, right?

55
00:02:23.926 --> 00:02:26.873
Okay, and after that, we're gonna take a deep dive

56
00:02:26.873 --> 00:02:30.146
into some of the most advanced features of the language,

57
00:02:30.146 --> 00:02:32.907
which is objects and functions.

58
00:02:32.907 --> 00:02:34.931
So we're gonna talk about advanced stuff

59
00:02:34.931 --> 00:02:38.199
like prototype inheritance, first-class functions,

60
00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:41.309
and closures, and also a lot more.

61
00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:44.165
And finally our biggest real-world project,

62
00:02:44.165 --> 00:02:46.511
where everything that we learn up until that point

63
00:02:46.511 --> 00:02:50.285
comes together and starts making even more sense.

64
00:02:50.285 --> 00:02:52.481
So we're gonna code this beautiful budget app

65
00:02:52.481 --> 00:02:55.104
where you can track incomes and expenses

66
00:02:55.104 --> 00:02:58.198
and calculate the global budget for a month.

67
00:02:58.198 --> 00:03:00.039
So, really cool again.

68
00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:01.082
And you're still gonna learn

69
00:03:01.082 --> 00:03:02.991
lots of new stuff in this project,

70
00:03:02.991 --> 00:03:05.429
like how to structure and organize your code

71
00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:09.856
and how to actually think about problems and solutions.

72
00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.148
So this is really the coolest

73
00:03:11.148 --> 00:03:13.472
and biggest part of the course.

74
00:03:13.472 --> 00:03:15.903
Okay, and finally we're gonna move on

75
00:03:15.903 --> 00:03:18.701
to the new, modern version of JavaScript,

76
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:23.144
which is ES6, or ES2015, so that you're always up to date

77
00:03:23.144 --> 00:03:25.638
with your JavaScript skills.

78
00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:27.996
And so in this section, we're gonna take a look

79
00:03:27.996 --> 00:03:30.284
at some of new features of the language,

80
00:03:30.284 --> 00:03:33.600
and also see some practical applications.

81
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.321
Okay, and that's what we're gonna cover in this course.

82
00:03:37.321 --> 00:03:40.182
And I also included some coding challenges for you,

83
00:03:40.182 --> 00:03:43.746
so that you can immediately practice what you learn.

84
00:03:43.746 --> 00:03:45.061
And to make this even better,

85
00:03:45.061 --> 00:03:47.903
I also included a 30-question exam

86
00:03:47.903 --> 00:03:50.038
for you to test out your knowledge

87
00:03:50.038 --> 00:03:52.799
that you gained from this course.

88
00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.113
And now I hope that you have a lot of fun with this course

89
00:03:55.113 --> 00:03:58.189
and that you're really gonna become a better web developer.

90
00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:01.939
So, without further ado, let's dive right in.
